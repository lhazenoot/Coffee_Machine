Stage 5/6: Keeping track of the supplies
Description
We can carry on and make things more interesting, can't we? Let's improve the program so it can do multiple actions, one after another. It must repeatedly ask users what they want to do. Users can input either buy, fill, or take, and then the program does the same thing it did in the previous step. However, if users want to turn off the coffee machine, they should type in exit. The program terminates after this command. Also, when users type in remaining, the program should output all coffee machine resources. This means that you shouldn't show the remaining stock levels at the beginning/end of the program.

Objectives
Write a program that continuously makes coffee for everyone until the shutdown command is provided. Introduce two new options: remaining and exit.

Do not forget that you can overstretch your supplies while making coffee. If the coffee machine doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message saying that it can't make it anymore and state what is missing.

And the last improvement to the program at this step â€” if users enter buy to buy a cup of coffee but change their mind afterward, allow them to input back to return to the main menu.

Set the following initial supplies: 400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans, 9 disposable cups, $550.

Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
